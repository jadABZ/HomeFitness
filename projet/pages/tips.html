                    <p>Spending time in forests, hiking in mountains, and just being outside can lead to significant health benefits. Studies have shown that walking in the woods can improve blood pressure, boost mental health, and decrease cancer risk. So go spend some time "forest-bathing" to improve your health.</p>

                    <p>Switching to a healthy diet doesn’t have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don’t have to change your eating habits all at once—that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan. A better approach is to make a few small changes at a time, which can help you achieve more in the long term without feeling deprived or overwhelmed by a major diet overhaul. Think of planning a healthy diet as a number of small, manageable steps—like adding a salad to your diet once a day. As your small changes become habit, you can continue to add more healthy choices.</p>

                    <p>Physical activity or exercise can improve your health and reduce the risk of developing several diseases like type 2 diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Physical activity and exercise can have immediate and long-term health benefits. Most importantly, regular activity can improve your quality of life. Even when you have busy day, at least try to go for a 30 minute walk. A 30-minutes workout takes only 2% of your day!</p>
